## Fibonacci Heap[C++]

## Getting Started
Fibonacci heap is a data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered trees. It has a better amortized running time than many other priority queue data structures including the binary heap and binomial heap.

Average time complexity in big O notation:
+ Insert		    Θ(1)
+ Find-min		  Θ(1)
+ Delete-min		Θ(log n)	 
+ Decrease-key	Θ(1)	 
+ Merge		      Θ(1)

## Prerequisites
C++(any version)

## Versioning
This is still a basic version i was told to do at my university. In a short amount of time(around April) I will improve this project by adding generics and deleting code smells.
